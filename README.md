# FastHTML L402 Marketplace Examples

This repository contains two examples of L402 marketplaces built using FastHTML, demonstrating different approaches to backend integration and customization.

## Project Structure

- `00_market_full_example/`: Full-featured marketplace with backend storage & L402 management.
- `01_market_react_clone/`: Simplified marketplace clone of a React app using Fewsats API as backend.

## 00_market_full_example

This example showcases a complete marketplace with:

- Full backend control and data storage
- Local file storage for uploaded items
- Customizable backend logic
- More complex setup but greater flexibility

## 01_market_react_clone

This example demonstrates a streamlined approach:

- Direct integration with Fewsats API (no backend storage)
- Easier setup and deployment
- Limited to frontend customization
- Ideal for quick prototyping or simple marketplaces


For specific setup instructions and features, please refer to the README in each example directory.
